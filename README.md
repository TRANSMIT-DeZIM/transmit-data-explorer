[Transnational Perspectives on Migration and Integration (TRANSMIT)](https://www.dezim-institut.de/projekte/projekt-detail/transnational-perspectives-on-migration-and-integration-transmit-7-13/) collects data in Lebanon, TÃ¼rkiye, Morocco, Italy, Nigeria, Senegal, the Gambia, and Germany.
TRANSMIT is a migration research project of the [DeZIM-Forschungsgemeinschaft (DeZIM FG)](https://www.dezim-institut.de/dezim-forschungsgemeinschaft/ueber-die-forschungsgemeinschaft/) and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ).
The project is carried out in cooperation with the [Berliner Institut fÃ¼r empirische Integrations- und Migrationsforschung (BIM)](https://www.bim.hu-berlin.de/), the [Institute for Employment Research (IAB)](https://iab.de/), the [Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies (IMIS)](https://www.imis.uni-osnabrueck.de/dezim/transmit_transnational_perspectives_on_migration_and_integration.html), the [Mannheim Center for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en), and the [Berlin Social Science Center (WZB)](https://www.wzb.eu/de/forschung/migration-und-diversitaet/migration-integration-transnationalisierung/projekte/transmit-transnational-perspectives-on-migrant-integration).
The project studies the complex interplay between migration dynamics, migrants' well-being, and integration processes by building a transnational data infrastructure that collects and links quantitative and qualitative data and knowledge on countries of origin, transit, and destination.
